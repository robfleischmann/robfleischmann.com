# Project for Robfleischmann.com
Hello, my name is Rob Fleischmann and I've been a web developer for over 15 years.
I've seen a lot of technology change over the years, and one I am particularly interested in is React.
My website is a React + Redux + Bootstrap project, and one I hope can be useful if you are learning React yourself.

### This project is based on the following technologies, follow the links to get more information

- The project was initially setup using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
